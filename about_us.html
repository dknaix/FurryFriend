						 In these times, the animals have no sources of food nor are well-wishers and caregivers allowed to
						 step out to feed them. With the support of the government, authorities and volunteers, we have been
						  feeding over 1200 animals for over 60 days. This has placed an immense strain on our resources and
							we require your support and contributions to get through these times
