						<br><br>Adopting a animal, dog or cat, is not something to be undertaken lightly. Cats can live as long as 15 years and dogs upto 20 years.
						We want to ensure that any animals it places for adoption go to people who will provide them with an appropriate, clean, safe, family environment,
						will feed them properly, take care of them when they are sick, and will – above all – give them love until the end of their days.
